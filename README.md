# py-grid
Python scripts for numerical grid generation in computational fluid dynamics.. or decorations(?)

This is a collection of Python script used to generate computational grid for my Master's works. The original works are all in
Fortran, and I was not in a mood to search them under my historical piles of codes and datas.
